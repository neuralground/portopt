# Frontend Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the portfolio optimization frontend.

## Testing Layers

Our testing approach follows the testing pyramid, with multiple layers of tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components and hooks in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Testing complete user flows

## Testing Tools

We use the following tools for testing:

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework for unit and integration tests
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**: For mocking API requests
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing

## Implementation Plan

Our testing implementation follows a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Unit Testing with Jest and React Testing Library ✅

- Set up Jest configuration
- Create unit tests for key components
- Test the solver type selection functionality

### Phase 2: API Mocking with Mock Service Worker ✅

- Set up MSW handlers for API endpoints
- Create mock responses for benchmark configurations and runs
- Test API integration in hooks

### Phase 3: End-to-End Testing with Cypress ✅

- Set up Cypress configuration
- Create E2E tests for key user flows
- Test the solver selection and benchmark running process

### Phase 4: Continuous Integration ✅

- Set up GitHub Actions workflow
- Configure to run all tests on pull requests
- Ensure tests run on relevant file changes

### Phase 5: Visual Regression Testing (Future)

- Set up Storybook for component documentation
- Implement visual regression testing with Chromatic
- Ensure UI changes don't unexpectedly alter component appearance

## Test Coverage

Our tests focus on the following key areas:

1. **Component Rendering**: Ensuring components render correctly
2. **User Interactions**: Testing user interactions like clicking buttons and selecting options
3. **API Integration**: Testing API calls and response handling
4. **State Management**: Testing state updates and data flow
5. **Error Handling**: Testing error states and edge cases

## Running Tests

See the README.md files in each test directory for specific instructions on running tests.

## Future Improvements

- Add more comprehensive test coverage for all components
- Implement snapshot testing for UI components
- Set up code coverage reporting
- Implement visual regression testing
