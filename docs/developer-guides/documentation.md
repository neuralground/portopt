# Portfolio Optimization Test Harness Documentation

## Overview
The Portfolio Optimization Test Harness provides a comprehensive framework for experimenting with and evaluating portfolio optimization algorithms. The system is designed to be modular, extensible, and focused on thorough testing across multiple dimensions of portfolio optimization challenges.

## Core Components

### Problem Definition (`portopt/core/problem.py`)
The `PortfolioOptProblem` class serves as the central data structure for portfolio optimization problems. Key features:
- Historical returns matrix
- Market impact data (volumes, spreads)
- Factor model data (returns, exposures)
- Classification data (industry, asset class, currency, credit)
- Built-in validation of problem instances

### Solvers
The system implements multiple solver approaches:

#### Base Solver Framework (`portopt/solvers/base.py`)
- Abstract base class for all solver implementations
- Common utility functions for constraint handling
- Weight processing and validation
- Performance metrics calculation

#### Constraint Adapter (`portopt/solvers/constraint_adapter.py`)
- Converts constraints between different solver formats
- Supports SciPy format for classical solvers
- Provides penalty functions for heuristic solvers
- Comprehensive constraint validation

#### Solver Factory (`portopt/solvers/factory.py`)
- Centralized creation and configuration of solvers
- Default configurations for different solver types
- Extensible registration system for new solvers
- Unified interface for solver creation

#### Classical Solver (`portopt/solvers/classical.py`)
- Sequential relaxation approach
- Handles non-linear constraints
- Supports warm starting
- Built-in penalty adjustment mechanism

#### Approximate Solvers (`portopt/solvers/approximate.py`)
- Genetic Algorithm implementation
  - Population-based evolutionary approach
  - Effective for non-convex problems (e.g., cardinality constraints)
  - Customizable genetic operators (selection, crossover, mutation)
- Simulated Annealing implementation
  - Temperature-based stochastic optimization
  - Good at avoiding local optima
  - Configurable cooling schedule

#### Quantum Solvers (`portopt/solvers/quantum.py`)
- Abstract base class for quantum implementations
- QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) placeholder
  - Parameterized quantum circuit approach
  - Hybrid quantum-classical optimization
- VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) placeholder
  - Hamiltonian-based quantum optimization
  - Customizable variational forms (ansatz)

#### Multithreaded Solver (`portopt/solvers/MultiThreadedSolver.py`)
- Parallel optimization attempts
- Enhanced exploration of solution space
- Suitable for larger problem instances

### Benchmarking (`portopt/benchmark/runner.py`)
The `BenchmarkRunner` class provides:
- Systematic performance evaluation
- Size scaling analysis
- Stress scenario testing
- Comprehensive metrics collection
- Automated reporting

### Market Impact (`portopt/impact/`)
Sophisticated market impact modeling with:
- Separate permanent and temporary impact
- Volume-based participation limits
- Spread cost modeling
- Decay effects

### Risk and Performance Metrics
Comprehensive metric calculation including:
- Standard risk metrics (VaR, CVaR)
- Factor exposures and attribution
- Transaction cost analysis
- Liquidity scoring

## Key Features

### Configuration Management
- Hierarchical configuration system
- Environment-specific settings
- Test-specific parameter sets
- Default fallbacks

### Visualization
- Interactive dashboard
- Risk decomposition plots
- Impact analysis visualization
- Performance attribution charts

### Constraint Handling
- Position limits

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from portopt import TestDataGenerator, ClassicalSolver

# Generate test problem
generator = TestDataGenerator()
problem = generator.generate_realistic_problem(
    n_assets=50,
    n_periods=252
)

# Create and run solver
solver = ClassicalSolver(max_iterations=20)
result = solver.solve(problem)
```

### Running Benchmarks
```python
from portopt.benchmark.runner import BenchmarkRunner

runner = BenchmarkRunner()
results = runner.run_size_scaling_benchmark(
    solver_classes=[ClassicalSolver],
    n_assets_range=[50, 100, 200],
    n_periods_range=[252, 504]
)
```
