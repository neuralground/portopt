# Computational Challenges in Portfolio Optimization

## The Complexity Challenge

### Fundamental Complexity
Portfolio optimization belongs to a class of problems that become exponentially more difficult as they grow in size. Several factors contribute to this complexity:

1. **Dimensionality**
   - N assets create an N-dimensional solution space
   - Number of possible portfolios grows exponentially with N
   - Covariance matrix has N(N+1)/2 unique elements
   - Factor models add FÃ—N factor exposures

2. **Non-linear Constraints**
   - Transaction costs are non-linear with trade size
   - Market impact creates feedback effects
   - Risk measures like VaR are non-linear
   - Cardinality constraints create discontinuities

3. **Dynamic Nature**
   - Parameters change over time
   - Market impact affects future trades
   - Transaction costs depend on execution path
   - Rebalancing creates path dependencies

### Computational Complexity Classes

Different aspects of portfolio optimization fall into different complexity classes:

1. **Quadratic Programming (QP)**
   - Basic mean-variance optimization
   - Polynomial time with convex constraints
   - Well-studied solution methods exist

2. **Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)**
   - Problems with cardinality constraints
   - Minimum position sizes
   - NP-hard in general
   - Branch-and-bound methods commonly used

3. **Non-convex Optimization**
   - Market impact considerations
   - Complex risk measures
   - Local optima challenges
   - Global optimality not guaranteed
